        "description": "Propulsion is the generation of force by any combination of pushing or pulling to modify the translational motion of an object, which is typically a rigid body (or an articulated rigid body) but may also concern a fluid.[1] The term is derived from two Latin words: pro, meaning before or forward; and pellere, meaning to drive.[2] A propulsion system consists of a source of mechanical power, and a propulsor (means of converting this power into propulsive force)."

        "description": "A nozzle is a relatively simple device, just a specially shaped tube through which hot gases flow. Ramjets and rockets typically use a fixed convergent section followed by a fixed divergent section for the design of the nozzle. This nozzle configuration is called a convergent-divergent, or CD, nozzle. In a CD nozzle, the hot exhaust leaves the combustion chamber and converges down to the minimum area, or throat, of the nozzle."
